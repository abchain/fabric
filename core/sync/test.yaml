logging:

  # Default logging levels are specified here for each of the three peer
  # commands 'node', 'network' and 'chaincode'. For commands that have
  # subcommands, the defaults also apply to all subcommands of the command.
  # Valid logging levels are case-insensitive strings chosen from

  #     CRITICAL | ERROR | WARNING | NOTICE | INFO | DEBUG

  # The logging levels specified here can be overridden in various ways,
  # listed below from strongest to weakest:
  #
  # 1. The --logging-level=<level> command line option overrides all other
  #    specifications.
  #
  # 2. The environment variable CORE_LOGGING_LEVEL otherwise applies to
  #    all peer commands if defined as a non-empty string.
  #
  # 3. The environment variables CORE_LOGGING_[NODE|NETWORK|CHAINCODE]
  #    otherwise apply to the respective peer commands if defined as non-empty
  #    strings.
  #
  # 4. Otherwise, the specifications below apply.
