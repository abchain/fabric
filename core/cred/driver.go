package credentials

/*
	just like fabric, this is a module for manufacturing, managing and verifing
	credentials of txs and peers, base on the certificates with x.509 standard,
	and it was mostly the refactoring of crypto module in fabric 0.6
	(and somewhat like the mxing of bccsp & msp in fabric 1.0)
