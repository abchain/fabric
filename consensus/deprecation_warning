/*

    YA-fabric has introduced the new architecture for implement of consensus: the consensus framework.
    Developer can run their consensus module among the system chaincode, access and invoke the method
    in node_engine module instead of the interface for consensus in fabric 0.6

    YA-fabric use "legacy mode" to support the old consensus module, which can only use the legacy
    node (involving sole P2P network, ledger and chaincode supporting) and can not play the full power
    of YA-fabric

    Notice: the old impmelent of security is also be disabled
