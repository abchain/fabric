## YA-fabric

This is purposed to be another future of fabric 0.6, keeping the original architecture and continue it with our improvments.

The original readme can be found [here](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/v0.6/README.md)

## Our plans

* A "real" impelemnt for production, including some security and applicating consideration

* Completing some features and making improvments for the chaincode part

* Easy to be packed as a "standalone" blockchain, that is, the integration of chaincodes and fabric peer

* Our implement for the concurreny handling of transactions

* More consensus modules
